# Working With Invariants

- [x] Follow the instructions in [Invariants Concepts](InvariantsConcepts) to learn about preserved blocks and the correct structure of verifications in spec files.

- [x] Go back to your list of invariants for [ EnglishAuction](WritingRules/EnglishAuction) and prove integrityOfHighestBid

- [x] Go to solutions if you need help

> :warning: Note that both systems have known bugs in them. You can read more about the bugs and attack vectors in the README files of each system's directory.

Upload your solutions to the respective directories for a review by the Certora team.
