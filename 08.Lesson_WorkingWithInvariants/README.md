- [ ] Follow the instructions in [Invariants Concepts](InvariantsConcepts) to learn about preserved blocks and the correct structure of verifications in spec files.

- [ ] Go back to your list of invariants for [ EnglishAuction](WritingRules/EnglishAuction) and prove integrityOfHighestBid

- [ ] Go to solutions if you need help

Upload your solutions to the respective directories for a review by the Certora team.
