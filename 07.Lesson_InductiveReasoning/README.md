# Inductive Reasoning

</br>

- [x] Read the following articles on pre-conditions and post-conditions to understand how and when to use them:

  - [x] Blog post by Mátyás Lancelot Bors explaining on defining pre-condition, post-conditions and invariants in simple words - [Link](https://medium.com/@mlbors/preconditions-and-postconditions-5913fc0fcdaf)

  - [x] A lesson on specifications in MIT University. start at the _introduction_ and read up to _Specification structure_ including (make sure to stop at _Specifications in Java_) [^1] - [Link](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa17/classes/06-specifications/)

> :memo: If you feel you need some more explanations of the subject you can search the web for many additional great and free sources, including wikipedia [Preconditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precondition), [Postconditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcondition).

[^1]: The content was created for the course _Software Construction_ for [MIT University](https://web.mit.edu/).

- [x] Watch a lecture by Dr. James Wilcox on inductive reasoning for securing smart contracts - [Link](https://youtu.be/30BspXZs7q8) ([slides](Induction.pdf)).

- [ ] Follow the [InductionLesson](InductionLesson) instructions to practice inductive reasoning and writing invariants in CVL.

- [ ] Read about [invariants](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/cvl/invariants.html) in Certora Prover, to learn about invariants, their implementation in CVL, and the difference between them and rules.
- [ ] Follow the exercise in [Invariants](Invariants)

## Invariants for High Level Thinking About Properties

</br>

- [ ] Continue to next lesson: [Working With Invariants](../08.Lesson_WorkingWithInvariants) to learn about preserved blocks for invariants, and practice writing rules for your properties.
