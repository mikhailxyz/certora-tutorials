# Guided Exercise - Liquidity Pool With Flash Loans
- [ ] Read [Working with Multiple Contracts](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/multicontract/index.html)
- [ ] Look at the set of contracts in this directory created by the Certora team. Try to understand what the contracts do and how they operate in a high-level sense.
    
</br>

- [ ] Try to think about as many properties as you can for the main contract [Pool](Pool.sol). Write them down in your favorite word processor and upload them in a file named "pool_properties_solution" to the current directory.

</br>

- [ ] Go over the list of properties in [properties List](propertiesList.md) to see an example of a preparation to a verification project. The properties are categorized, prioritized, and fully detailed to explain the essence of the property in a few sentences or logic.

</br>

- [ ] Have a look at the prepared `.spec` file [high Level](highLevel.spec) and try to read the properties. 

</br>

- [ ] Go back to your set of properties and see if you have any additional ideas after reading the example list. Make sure to upload your changes.

- [ ] If possible, reach out to a fellow participant of the onboarding course and discuss your properties with them. Exchange thoughts and ideas.

> :memo: The Certora Team will review your solution and give you a personal review. In the following days, you will exercise thinking about properties some more; we recommend waiting for your review before proceeding to the next exercise in this subject.
