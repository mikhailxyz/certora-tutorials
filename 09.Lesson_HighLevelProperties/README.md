# Some More Thinking About Properties

In this Lesson, after you've already practiced coming up with meaningful properties, we raise the bar with slightly more sophisticated contracts and focus on high-level properties.

> :information_source: Remember, high-level properties are properties that try to look at the big picture rather than a specific detail. An example to a high-level rule would be: "In a bank, a user can withdraw his/her rightful funds from the account." i.e. the bank suppose to allow withdrawal of funds that exist in the account at all time, but also no action from a 3rd party can prevent the user from withdrawing their funds.

> :warning: Note that transfer by approved 3rd party will change the account's balance legitimately.

High-level properties are usually implemented as invariants or parametric rules, as opposed to rules that monitor the behavior of the system as a result of a specific function call. The latter will very rarely represent high-level rules, due to its diminished "attack vector" possibility.

- [x] Go over [SymbolicPoolDemonstratione](SymbolicPoolDemonstration) to learn about multi-contract verification and exercise some more on coming up with properties, categorizing them, and prioritizing them.

- [x] Follow the instructions on [Thinking Properties Exercise](ThinkingPropertiesExercise) to exercise writing a full spec.

- [ ] Continue to the next lesson: [Vacuous Rules](../10.Lesson_VacuousRules) to learn about vacuous rules, how to avoid them, and how to catch them on time.
